# Linear Sizing Guide

This document defines the point system used for estimating work in Linear.

| Point | Time Equivalent | Example Tasks |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1     | ~1-2 hours      | Quick design tweak, simple prompt iteration, minor UI fix |
| 2     | ~half day       | Component design, feature vibe-code, integration work |
| 3     | ~1 day          | Full screen design, complex feature implementation |
| 4     | ~1.5 days       | Multi-component feature, design system additions |
| 5     | ~2 days         | Major feature requiring design + implementation |
